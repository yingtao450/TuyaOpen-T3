/**
 * @file sample_cxx.c
 * @brief Simple demonstration of a c++ program for SDK.
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of a basic c++ program
 * designed for Tuya IoT projects. It demonstrates the initialization of the
 * Tuya Abstract Layer (TAL) logging system, a simple loop to print debug
 * messages, and the use of a task thread for executing the main logic. The
 * program showcases fundamental concepts such as logging, task creation, and
 * conditional compilation based on the operating system. It serves as a
 * starting point for developers new to Tuya's IoT platform, illustrating how to
 * structure a simple application and utilize Tuya's SDK for basic operations.
 *
 * The code is structured to support different execution paths based on the
 * operating system, demonstrating the portability and flexibility of Tuya's IoT
 * SDK across various platforms.
 *
 * @note This example is designed for educational purposes and may need to be
 * adapted for production environments.
